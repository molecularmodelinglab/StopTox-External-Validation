# External Validation of STopTox as an Alternative to Animal Testing for Toxicological Assessments

This repository provides data and results supporting our study on evaluating the STopTox platform as a non-animal method for predicting chemical toxicity across six acute toxicity endpoints.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**  
  Contains curated datasets and source materials from ICE, ChemIDPlus, and other repositories.

- **results/**  
  Includes an Excel file with calculated metrics (CCR, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) for each toxicity endpoint, following the methodology described in Borba et al.

## Overview

STopTox leverages QSAR models to predict toxicity for endpoints such as:
- Acute oral toxicity
- Acute dermal toxicity
- Acute inhalation toxicity
- Skin sensitization
- Skin irritation/corrosion
- Eye irritation/corrosion

External validation using independent datasetssupports that STopTox can serve as a reliable alternative to animal testing, supporting regulatory efforts aligned with the principles of reducing, refining, and replacing animal use.
